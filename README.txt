Developers can start using the app after performing these steps:
  1. Install chrome's 'livereload' extension.
  2. Execute 'gulp' in the command prompt once you are in the 'truewheel' project.

Traverse to http://localhost:3000/ in chrome after turning on livereload. Start seeing the changes reflected on the browser as soon as you save files in this project (Look at gulpfile.js for this configuration).
